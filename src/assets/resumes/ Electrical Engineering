PROJECTS	

K9Kinetics  					                                   
Senior Capstone Project	Sep 2024 – Mar 2025

Led a team of 3 to develop an iOS application and accompanying hardware to monitor real-time GPS location with sub 5 meter accuracy, temperature tracking with ±1℃ accuracy, and other live telemetry data on a device built to autonomously capture canine/equine health data through integrated sensor systems.
Software Tooling: Docker, Linux, Github, Arduino, Xcode
Hardware: Arduino MKR NB 1500, Arduino MKR ASX0017 GPS Hat, Sparkfun Micro IMU + interfaces

STM32 Low-Power Motion Detector 					                                   
Embedded Systems – CSC 316	Dec 2024

For my class final project, I chose to interface a PIR sensor with the STM32 (ARM microprocessor) in order to learn about relevant systems not covered in other class projects: specifically power modes and watchdog timers.
