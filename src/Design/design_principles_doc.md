## Visual Identity

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- `--color-bg: #fefcf8` - Warm off-white background
- `--color-surface: #ffffff` - Pure white for elevated content
- `--color-surface-alt: #f8f6f2` - Subtle alternate surface

**Text Hierarchy:**
- `--color-text-primary: #2c2c2c` - High contrast for headings and important content
- `--color-text-secondary: #666666` - Medium contrast for body text
- `--color-text-muted: #999999` - Low contrast for supplementary information

**Accent & Interaction:**
- `--color-accent: #8b7355` - Muted sage brown for CTAs and highlights
- `--color-accent-light: #a68b68` - Lighter variant for hover states
- `--color-border: #e8e5e0` - Subtle borders and dividers
- `--color-hover: #f2f0ed` - Gentle hover background

**Design Rationale:** Warm, earth-toned palette creates approachability while maintaining professionalism. Colors are muted enough to not distract from content, but distinctive enough to create visual hierarchy.

### Typography System
**Font Stack:** `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', system-ui, sans-serif`

**Scale & Hierarchy:**
- Hero Title: `clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)` - Responsive scaling
- Section Titles: `2.5rem` - Clear section breaks
- Subsections: `1.25rem` - Secondary importance
- Body Text: `1rem` (16px base) - Optimal readability
- Metadata: `0.9rem` - Reduced emphasis

**Typography Principles:**
- Letter spacing: `-0.02em` for large text (improved readability)
- Line height: `1.6` for body text (enhanced readability)
- Font weight variations create clear information hierarchy
- System fonts ensure fast loading and native feel

## Spatial Design & Layout

### Grid System
**Container:** `max-width: 1200px` with responsive padding
**Project Grid:** `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(350px, 1fr))` - Flexible, responsive layout
**Timeline:** `max-width: 800px` - Optimal reading width for experience content

### Spacing Scale
**Consistent rhythm using multiples of 8px:**
- Micro: `8px, 12px, 16px` - Component internal spacing
- Small: `24px, 32px` - Related element spacing
- Medium: `40px, 60px` - Section internal spacing
- Large: `80px, 120px` - Major section separation

### Visual Hierarchy
**Elevation System:**
- `--shadow-sm: 0 2px 8px rgba(139, 115, 85, 0.08)` - Subtle card elevation
- `--shadow-md: 0 4px 16px rgba(139, 115, 85, 0.12)` - Interactive state elevation
- Border radius: `12px` - Modern, approachable feel

---

## Interactive Design

### Animation Philosophy
**"Purposeful Motion"** - Animations serve to guide user attention and provide feedback, never to distract or showboat.

### Animation Specifications
**Timing:** `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` - Natural, iOS-inspired easing
**Duration:** `0.3s` - Fast enough to feel responsive, slow enough to be perceived
**Transform Properties:** Prefer `transform` and `opacity` for performance

**Interaction States:**
- Hover: `translateY(-2px to -8px)` with `scale(1.02)` for emphasis
- Active: Subtle color shifts using accent variants
- Focus: Clear visual indicators for accessibility

### Scroll-Triggered Animations
**Intersection Observer Implementation:**
- `threshold: 0.1` - Trigger when 10% visible
- `rootMargin: '0px 0px -50px 0px'` - Earlier triggering for natural feel
- Staggered delays: `200ms` between project cards for fluid revelation

## Content Strategy & Information Architecture

### Page Structure
1. **Hero Section** - Immediate value proposition and personality
2. **Projects Section** - Technical capability demonstration
3. **Experience Section** - Professional credibility building
4. **Contact Section** - Clear next steps for engagement

### Content Principles
**Scannable Hierarchy:** Users should understand your value within 10 seconds
**Progressive Disclosure:** Essential information first, details available on interaction
**Technical Accessibility:** Complex concepts explained through visual and interactive elements

### Project Showcase Strategy
**Card-Based Architecture:**
- Visual preview area for screenshots/demos
- Clear title and concise description
- Technology tags for quick skill assessment
- Dual CTAs: "Live Demo" (primary action) + "Source Code" (technical validation)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Priorities
**Critical Rendering Path:**
- Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content
- System fonts eliminate external requests
- Optimized images and progressive loading

**JavaScript Strategy:**
- Vanilla JS for maximum performance and control
- Progressive enhancement: full functionality without JavaScript
- Lightweight interactions using modern APIs (Intersection Observer, Web Animations)

### Responsive Behavior
**Breakpoint Strategy:**
- Mobile-first approach with `min-width` media queries
- Flexible grid systems that adapt rather than hide content
- Typography scaling using `clamp()` for fluid responsiveness

**Mobile Optimizations:**
- Simplified navigation (hamburger menu consideration)
- Touch-friendly interaction targets (minimum 44px)
- Reduced animation complexity for performance
